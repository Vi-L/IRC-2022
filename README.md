# 2022 IRC Team Stripes Robot Code

Robot code for auto, driving, and scoring 

## TODOs:
- Update Drivetrain.java and Arm.java VictorSP port numbers (just need to see where wires are on RIO)
- Test driving, make sure everything works
- Test auto, right now auto commands / durations are guesses
- Finish arm code
